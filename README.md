# Chamelearn: A Web-based Japanese Language Learning App

This application is developed as part of author's final year project titled "ADAPTIVE USER INTERFACE FOR SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNING WEB APPLICATION".

## Project Aim

The project aims to integrate an Adaptive User Interface (AUI) on a Japanese language learning web application to improve user's learning outcome.

It focuses on improving the learning experience by adapting the user interface to suit individual learning styles based on the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM), helping learners engage more effectively with vocabulary, reading, listening, and grammar in context.

## Project Background

The AUI is able to keep track of user's learning styles and update the user interface to accommodate user's learning preferences. For example, if the user interacts more frequently with the interface designed for Visual learners, the system will interpret it as a tendency towards the Visual end in the Visual-Verbal spectrum, resulting in more video content being presented on the next page switch.

In order to study whether the AUI helps to improve user's second language learning outcome, a between-subjects experiment was designed and carried out. **`Lesson B is integrated with the AUI whereas Lesson A is not.`** Participants were split into two independent groups; one learns with Lesson A and the other learns with Lesson B. To measure the learning outcome for each group, the result of the Final Quiz will be used.

## How to Install and Run the Project (using localhost server)

Steps:

1. Open the project folder as a Visual Studio Code project.
2. Open two terminal instances by using [**Ctrl + Shift + `** ] twice.
3. Run `cd frontend` on one of the terminals and `cd backend` on the other. One will serve as the frontend server and the other as the backend server.
4. Run `npm run dev` on both terminal to start the project. Your terminals should show this(image below) when it is started: ![alt text](image.png)
5. In the frontend terminal, press [**o + Enter**] to open Chamelearn in your browser.
